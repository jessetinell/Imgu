Imgu
====
Sorting images/videos with one click. 
## How?
* Drag and drop files into Imgu
* Click sort! 


Purpose
-------------
I like to keep my images and videos organized and I take alot of pictures with my camera and smartphone. 
Instead of creating each directory manually I built Imgu. Nowadays my files are synced with Dropbox's Camera Uploads and sometimes now and then I just open Imgu, sync files via the Dropbox-button and click SORT. All directories are automatically created and files are COPIED to respective folder. 


Sorting hierarchy
-------------
- Main directory
  - Year
    - Month
      - Day
        - Files!


Other functionality
-------------
* Edit the date of a jpeg's metadata (buggy)
* One-click-import of files in a pre-defined and saved directory. Mainly built to quickly get Camera Uploads from Dropbox
* Hover-preview of images in the list


Note
-------------
I made this when i was studying and it does not have the best coding practices... :)
